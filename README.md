# Monthly Income Prediction

## Project Overview

By engaging stakeholders, we clarified that high employee turnover rates are costly, and understanding the salary range employees would expect in order to stay could improve retention. "What salary predicts employee retention based on historical data?"

## Research Question
What is the relationship between salary and employee retention across different job roles and departments?
What salary ranges (minimum, maximum) are associated with the highest retention rates for specific job roles or levels?
